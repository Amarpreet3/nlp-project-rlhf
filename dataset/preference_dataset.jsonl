{"input_text": "I've been feeling very hopeless lately, and I'm not sure where to turn for advice. I went to college right out of high school, floated along for almost five years, changing majors twice (Sculpture, to English Lit, to General Studies).

Currently, I work 40 hours a week at a job I enjoy, but it pays me barely enough to live and there's not really upward mobility within the company.

My question for you wonderful people is multi-faceted because I'm floundering and also open to suggestions.\nShould I go back to school? I went to a state school, and I'm sure at least two years of my credits will transfer into another program. Can I finish my degree at a local community college?

She didn't even ask how I was doing after surgery, I had to call her.

In high school, I had to cut back and now only play golf and baseball. I'm not playing either in college (although I will more than likely continue to golf throughout life).

Since then, I've been bogged down with work and snow in the Northeast, so I haven't had much chance at all to run. It's actually been pretty depressing, as I felt like I was making good progress. I had cut down about 15 pounds, which is a definite positive for me.

What should I expect? Does anybody have any recommendations? I want to perform at a high level for my team, but this is it for baseball for me.

{"input_text": "Hey everyone, I am a 21 year old loser (by society's standards) and I'm starting to believe it too.\n\nOkay so here is the problem that is my life. My license is currently suspended because at the time of the suspension i did not have enough money to pay for car insurance and also being a dumb young kid out on my own. My previous insurance carrier notified the dmv my plan expired. After my license was suspended i drove my car on a suspended license and uninsured to a job. I eventually made enough money to pay for a six month insurance premium (2,200$) (esurance) the dmv told me i had to get an sr-22 which basically is a document from the insurance company that states i did pay for a six month premium that is needed in order to reinstate license needed by the dmv. \n\nDuring those happy six months of driving insured i lost my job (restaurant) and now i was left with less than 2,200$ that was needed to buy another 6 month premium. I also needed 250$ on top of that as a reinstatement fee. As of now i just recently my broken car (engine) for 4,000$ and i have 1,000$ in my account from my tax return. So i have 5,000$ no car and a suspended license. If i were to use the money i have to spend on reinstatement it would leave me with 2,200$. Assuming esurance will still let me hold a policy.\n\n I would like to buy another car for at least 4-5,000$ so i don't have to spend all my money on repairs and maintenance.

His legs fall out from underneath him, and before he could protect himself with his arms (he was using them to push people away), he lands face first on the concrete.

I have tried to dig deep into my mind and remove what ever clamp my ex still holds over me, but to no avail.

Evidently, this works for her because she was always taught growing up that masturbating is like, super wrong (sexual immorality by view of overly strict religious father), but of course she did it on occasion anyway for the same reasons we all do. So, instead of cutting herself, she taught herself to go do that, and then, (they way she described it), she would use the guilt of being \"sexually immoral\" that came afterwards as her means of self punishment and dwell on her idea that she was terrible for doing this until she felt the \"punishment\" was sufficient; as an alternative to cutting. \nEvidently this has gotten to the point of what i think is called a learned reaction in the psychology world. She said that there's been a few times where she will go to masturbate, simply as a stress relief, (after seeing the idea online) or to help her sleep (basically any reason besides self punishment), but instead of the intended reaction, she will automatically start crying and feeling like crap as was intended all those other times. \nRecently she, for the first time, got close with a guy (her first boyfriend), and while she stopped before she completely orgasmed or anything, she evidently got the same reaction, cried got super upset and felt terrible.

{"input_text": "So everyone knows you choose Traditional if you're in a high tax bracket now and it will be lower later and choose Roth if you are in a low tax bracket now but will be bringing in more money in retirement.  But no one mentions you can figuratively cram more money into a Roth account.  Let me explain:\n\nYou have an excess of income and will be maxing your 401(k).  If you max out your Roth, you have to pay taxes on all that money, and actually end up with less money now than if you maxed your Traditional.  So basically, in your Traditional account you have the maxed amount minus future taxes.  But in your Roth, you have a full max 401(k).  That's not a fair comparison.  Lets say in the traditional case we take any money not spent on taxes up front and put it in an investment account getting the same rate of return as the 401(k).  Assuming the tax bracket stays the same, upon withdrawal, the Roth account holder will end up with more money since he didn't have to pay a second round of taxes on that non tax advantaged investment account.

But being a new member, she spent most of her evening going around introducing herself to be polite.  I was only able to converse with her for a short while, and I wasn't able to fit in anything to gauge interest.  It was a 'Hi I am so-and-so, I moved from ____, I work in _____, and it is nice to meet you' type of conversation.\n\nThis bring me to my question.  The only way for me to contact her at this point in time is through her profile on the organizations website.  Contacting her there does not feel 'proper' to me, especially because I do not even know if she is single.  The next meeting is a month from now and I feel as though I should wait and speak with her then, but I have no idea if she will be in attendance.\n\nSo, ladies.. Would you be creeped out if a man were to go out of his way to find a way to contact you and ask you out, or would you find it flattering?  On the flip side, would you prefer it if he did so in person?  Keep in mind that we only spoke briefly, and I do not know her relationship status.  Also keep in mind that I am attractive, fit, and well-kept because (sadly) that seems to sometimes be the difference between cute and creepy.

Well my good friend texted me individually, which led to me stating I was upset with the fact that our friendship crumbled, and more over upset with her, because she really did nothing in my time of woe.  \n\nI go on to learn that she didn't have a great year either, and that was one of the reasons we drifted apart.  I am torn.  I feel so selfish that I expected her to really be the rock I needed, but also disgusted in myself I never really thought that she could be going through rough times as well.  A couple walls of texts later, we come to conclusion that we both messed up, and are both to blame for our falling out.  It just doesn't feel right.  Whatever friendship we had left is now even more unstable, and I think she is really mad and/or upset with me now.  All while I feel lost on what to do.  I really, really care about this friend.  I just don't know how to get things back to normal, if it can even get back to normal.  \n\nThank you. [summary]: ", "candidate_0": " Fell out with friend from 6th grade/up through college.

{"input_text": "Some background: My mom converted to Mormonism when I was 2 and I was brought up in the church.

I'm a spoiled 16 year old in a nice neighborhood, and my dumbass friend wanted me to join him at his own personal bake sale.\n\nI live in a nice neighborhood, one where I know a lot of the adults.

{"input_text": "So just this last weekend I took the girl that I've been best friends with and liked for 4 years on a formal trip. She dated my best friend for nearly 2 years and broke up a year ago. Before this trip we hooked up drunk 3 weeks before. We hooked up 4 more times in 2 days while there. We got drunk one day at the beach and one thing lead to another and I ended up pouring my heart out to her.\n\nAfter I finished saying what I had to say, I asked her if she had feelings for me. She started saying that within the past month she's thought about us being in a relationship a lot and she said that she's not ready for it due to some hangups, one including me being her ex's best friend. She was really confused and unsure of everything. She called my best friend and hung up the phone. He called me and I confessed everything and immediately hung up the phone.\n\nJust to clarify, I spoke to him on 3 separate occasions about her dating other people including myself and he said he didn't care about it anymore and she was free to date whoever she wanted. He gave me permission to take her on this formal so he should've full well known the consequences.\n\nHe sent us both a text 4 hours later saying that he couldn't be friends with us anymore, etc etc. She starts crying while I'm angry and sad from getting crushed. The next day we have to drive back home which was an 12 hour trip and we said maybe 50 words the ride home. I sent her a very long text apologizing for the previous night.\n\nOnce we were home and apart from each other, I told her I wanted time away so we could think about whatever we needed to. She kept texting me and I told her to stop because we needed time to figure out what we want. I haven't talked to her since. What should I think of this?

{"input_text": "I've come to the conclusion that I suck at emotionally supporting pretty much everyone in my life. I think it stems mostly from the fact that I'm a problem solver by nature and tend to skip over the emotional aspects of stuff and go straight to a solution.

My sister is being taken advantage of by some manipulative renters. After hearing about the horror stories I tell her they need to go asap. She doesn't really respond to this, so I'm thinking maybe she just needs to vent and wants some compassion.
