{"input_text": "We bought a house! But the paint colors aren't great - lots of bright colors in what used to be kids' rooms and walls in need of retouching in the common areas. I'd like to get starting on the paint project right away and my family will be visiting in two weeks to help - so I'd like to develop a paint scheme to go off of. \n I get a little overwhelmed when contemplating the seemingly endless paint colors at Home Depot. I want neutral walls, but should I stick with one shade throughout or mix it up? Is beige blah, is cream too boring, and could anyone tell me what #%&! greige is? \n My couch is brown leather, the entertainment center, kitchen table, and bedroom furniture are a warm cherry, and the cabinetry is maple. Since we'll be buying furniture over time as funds allow, I think neutral walls that play well off other colors is my best bet. The house gets gorgeous light from western facing windows, but even still I don't want to go too dramatic or dark. [summary]: ", "output_text": "Help me pick paint colors!"}
{"input_text": "Hello. I recently changed around a little bit on my router settings. To be more specific, only the channels. I had a problem with an extender, which had a problem where the signal would get weaker every 25th second (If anyone can recommend a solution to this as well, I will be more than happy to listen). So, I checked the internet before to se nothing was wrong, (10 ping, 25mbps) and looked through the settings later and changed the channel. When I realized all the other channels were no better, I changed back to the \"auto\" channel. After all this, my ping went up to 50, and mbps down to 15. I have no idea how that happened, and I appreciate your help. Thank you. \n The router I'm using is an old Linksys WRT54G with the Tomato OS, if that helps. And the extender is an Airlink2200AC [summary]: ", "output_text": "Extender didn't work well, changed channel on main router, changed channel back, internet is suddenly worse.

{"input_text": "This is my first post on this sub. I don't really know where else to turn. \n A few months ago my family found out that my father's heart murmur was going to require him to undergo a double valve replacement. My father has a history of depression, as well as sickle cell anemia, and my mother has had many a demon to battle in her lifetime. And that's not even including her own chronic illness. \n Leading up to the surgery, my father stayed surprisingly level headed and didn't sink too far into his depression, while my mother on the other hand, has become much worse regarding her own mental health. \n I'm happy to report that the surgery was successful and my father is doing fine physically. But it seems as though neither of my parents are doing very well emotionally. \n I live out of town, but my 23 year old sister and her 1 year old son live at home with them. This is obviously quite a struggle for them even though they won't admit it. My sister and I talk often and I try to visit at least once a month. My mother has become increasingly hostile towards all of us since the surgery. Every word that comes out of her mouth has this sharp, menacing edge to it, even when she isn't trying to be intentionally hurtful. I know its not her fault. I've dealt with my own mental health issues and I've been in her position before where my tone and attitude come across rude and hurtful without meaning to. Its a byproduct of depression and extreme stress. \n My father's depression has worsened since the surgery, and with that so has my mother's. The thing is, I don't think she wants to admit it. Her and my father got into a massive argument and now my mother is refusing to speak to him or even my sister at all because she feels she is constantly being attacked when we point out the nasty tone she has when she speaks. \n They both absolutely refuse to seek professional treatment regarding their mental health. I've been in therapy for most of my independent adult life and know how rewarding it can be but I just can't seem to get my parents to understand that they might need it too (even though they were the one who pressured me into therapy in the first place). \n At this point I'm not sure what to do. It's not a healthy situation for anyone involved and I'm afraid that they are going to send themselves into an early grave if they don't get help. We've always been so close as a family and my sister and I need them around and healthy, especially for my baby nephew's sake.

{"input_text": "On the left side of my house, I have a door that leads directly to the garage. I usually sneak out every night after work for some bed time tokes. So as per usual, I walk out, and I'm getting ready to light my pipe when I just see the back door open to the house in front of me; it's the neighbour with her two giant dogs, going out for a smoke.

But, one of the dogs started barking a little, and the other one started exploring, and I'm sitting down, hunched over, pipe in hand, trying not to make a sound, getting higher by the second.

{"input_text": "First off, this may be more of a software issue than a hardware issue...so checking here first. \n So I lost my password to iTunes first AND forgot what email I used for my iTunes long long ago. I have a 120GB iPod. What used to be a tank before the re-release of the 160GB. \n After switching to Ubuntu a couple of years ago I hadn't used the iPod for anything but a memory bank where I can store .MP3s and .WAVs. \n One day I decided to get my iPod up and running with new music using Banshee. I figured might as well use this thing as an MP3 player. So I wiped everything on the iPod out and began putting music on it with Banshee. I put like 9GBs of music on it and it worked as if I had still been using iTunes. Everything seemed legit...for a couple weeks. \n I recently put some Single hits (e.g., percussion samples from drum machines) in MP3 format for sampling purposes  because I make beats and can re-sample them from external hardware. \nThe iPod had difficulty playing 0:01 second MP3s. After trying to play a few of them it would skip over some and freeze for a few seconds. \n I let the iPod battery run out and recharged it using a wall charger. After it charged up it became extremely dysfunctional. It is now officially 'special'. The songs would never play anymore and none of the buttons were doing what they were intended to do now. It froze for long periods of time and eventually it froze for good. \n I plugged it into my girlfriend's computer (Windows7 OS) just as the Apple logo appeared on the screen. The computer recognized the iPod. I clicked on the external drive showing an iPod graphic and the screen turned white on the iPod. It warned me to not disconnect in white screen. I tried to access the files but the files are not recognizable. My computer running Ubuntu is 20 miles away and I cannot get to it at the moment. What can I do to fix this? Is it dead?

Also, UNHS spelt my address wrong but DHL still delivered promptly. Unfortunately only 1 of 3 items were inside the package... \n THE PRODUCT--------\nCame packaged in a zip-loc bag. Folded up. Pretty ordinary. No labels, stickers or receipt. The jacket was \u00a335. I am 6ft and about 180lbs and ordered an XL. To my disappointment, it barely fits me despite going for the largest size option. The overall quality is decent, however there were quite a few loose threads but I cleaned that up myself.

The top 2 buttons that are supposed to be closer to each other than the rest of the buttons are accurate, which is a nice touch.
