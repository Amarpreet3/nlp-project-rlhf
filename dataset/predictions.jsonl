I had a problem with an extender, which had a problem where the signal would get weaker every 25th second (If anyone can recommend a solution to this as well, I will be more than happy to listen). So, I checked the internet before to se nothing was wrong, (10 ping, 25mbps) and looked through the settings later and changed the channel. When I realized all the other channels were no better, I changed back to the \"auto\" channel. After all this, my ping went up to 50, and mbps down to 15. I have no idea how that happened, and I appreciate your help. Thank you. \n The router I'm using is an old Linksys WRT54G with the Tomato OS, if that helps.

I don't really know where else to turn. \n A few months ago my family found out that my father's heart murmur was going to require him to undergo a double valve replacement. My father has a history of depression, as well as sickle cell anemia, and my mother has had many a demon to battle in her lifetime. And that's not even including her own chronic illness. \n Leading up to the surgery, my father stayed surprisingly level headed and didn't sink too far into his depression, while my mother on the other hand, has become much worse regarding her own mental health. \n I'm happy to report that the surgery was successful and my father is doing fine physically. But it seems as though neither of my parents are doing very well emotionally. \n I live out of town, but my 23 year old sister and her 1 year old son live at home with them. This is obviously quite a struggle for them even though they won't admit it. My sister and I talk often and I try to visit at least once a month. My mother has become increasingly hostile towards all of us since the surgery. Every word that comes out of her mouth has this sharp, menacing edge to it, even when she isn't trying to be intentionally hurtful. I know its not her fault. I've dealt with my own mental health issues and I've been in her position before where my tone and attitude come across rude and hurtful without meaning to. Its a byproduct of depression and extreme stress. \n My father's depression has worsened since the surgery, and with that so has my mother's. The thing is, I don't think she wants to admit it. Her and my father got into a massive argument and now my mother is refusing to speak to him or even my sister at all because she feels she is constantly being attacked when we point out the nasty tone she has when she speaks. \n They both absolutely refuse to seek professional treatment regarding their mental health. I've been in therapy for most of my independent adult life and know how rewarding it can be but I just can't seem to get my parents to understand that they might need it too (even though they were the one who pressured me into therapy in the first place). \n At this point I'm not sure what to do. It's not a healthy situation for anyone involved and I'm afraid that they are going to send themselves into an early grave if they don't get help. We've always been so close as a family and my sister and I need them around and healthy, especially for my baby nephew's sake.", "targets_pretokenized": ""}, "prediction": "The author's first Reddit post details their family's struggles with their father's heart murmur requiring surgery, exacerbated by their parents' mental health issues.

I figured might as well use this thing as an MP3 player. So I wiped everything on the iPod out and began putting music on it with Banshee. I put like 9GBs of music on it and it worked as if I had still been using iTunes.
